This repository implements a connectivity-preserving loss function designed to improve instance segmentation of curvilinear structures. The paradigm shift here is to evaluate segmentation quality at the “structure-level” as opposed to the voxel-level. The loss is computed by detecting supervoxels in the false positive and false negative masks during training, then assigning higher penalties to *critical* supervoxels that introduce connectivity errors.

## Method

The loss computation consists of three main steps:

<blockquote>
  <p>a. <strong>Binarized Prediction</strong>: Prediction generated by neural network is thresholded into a binary mask to separate foreground from background.</p>
  <p>b. <strong>False Postive/Negative Masks</strong>: Computed by comparing binarized prediction to the ground truth.</p>
  <p>c. <strong>Critical Supervoxels</strong>: Detect connected components in false positive/negative mask that cause connectivity errors.</p>
</blockquote>

Finally, the loss is computed by comparing the prediction with the ground truth segmentation, applying higher penalties to voxels within critical supervoxels that affect connectivity.
